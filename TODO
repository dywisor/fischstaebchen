# Classifications:
# * TODO          --  things that should be done and I'm interested
#                     in implementing these
# * INCOMPLETE    --  feature is incomplete and not top-priority for me
# * ENHANCEMENT   --  missing feature I'm not really interested in
#                      (That usually means that I'd accept patches for it.)
# * BROKEN        --  broken
# * TESTING       --  needs further testing
