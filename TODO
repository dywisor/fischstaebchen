# Classifications:
# * TODO          --  things that should be done and I'm interested
#                     in implementing these
# * INCOMPLETE    --  feature is incomplete and not top-priority for me
# * ENHANCEMENT   --  missing feature I'm not really interested in
#                      (That usually means that I'd accept patches for it.)
# * BROKEN        --  broken
# * TESTING       --  needs further testing
# * WTF           --  undefined behavior of any kind (lacks documentation, is just weird)

TODO            documentation.
TODO            buildroot package: set XSHELL
____            buildroot: remove==upstream apt-cacher-ng package
TODO            stagedive: inject VOLATILE_ROOTFS_*FILE, dont reparse
TODO            stagedive: uclibc TZ
TODO            stagedive: refactor parser
TODO            stagedive bootstrap: optionally keep gentoo stage3 file
TODO            overlay, init: phase-retry
                 (requires thoroughly-defined boot-phase status)
TODO            init: consider using posix_spawn()/vfork() instead of fork()
TODO            overlay: add support for init scripts
                 (/etc/init.d, @@HOOKDIR@@/svc)
                 + provide runscript wrapper
                 + maintain a list of active scripts via symlinks in /run/<...>
                 + stop scripts.
                 + could migrate networking to this new facility
TODO            stagedive: make it possible to override archstrap package lists
TODO            overlay: split data (e.g. stagedive package list) from code
INCOMPLETE      only rudimentary support for mdadm/lvm
ENHANCEMENT     metash.py is just ugly.
ENHANCEMENT     networking supports DHCP only
ENHANCEMENT     no resume from hibernate
ENHANCEMENT     load keymap during boot
ENHANCEMENT     no cryptsetup (luks), *cache, dmraid
ENHANCEMENT     stagedive: write to disk
ENHANCEMENT     init: when bind-mounting from volatile storage, create necessary dirs

WTF             file descriptor 3 passed to overlay hooks needs to be documented
BROKEN          latest buildroot-based builds:
                "vgscan --mknodes" and "vgchange" segfault in my testing vm,
                check:: incomplete /dev setup?, lvm2?, kernel config?
